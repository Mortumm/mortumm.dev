<p>Happy holidays loves, just a short breather.</p>

<p>21-10-2022</p>
<p>
    Geez, school and work keeping me really busy. Front end at work and at
    school the CompSci stuff are starting before november. Going to be rough fit
    with all of these... <br />Should open some more time for math to really
    dive in to. In a lighter note, theres a convention coming up I'm attending.
    Some of it will be just for laying back, networking and purely for fun.
</p>

<p>24-07-2022</p>
<p>Huh, I am aiming to become an engineer. Much wow.</p>

<p>16-06-2022</p>
<p>
    Holy shit. How can time pass so fast... More than a year later I'm back
    here.
</p>

<p>16-08-2021</p>
<p>Wadap. Again, updates are slow. Tough two years for all of us.</p>

<p>06-05-2021</p>
<p>
    Well, plans dont always play out like you'd hope. School is going good,
    professional life in general is in good lift. Tech and tinkering has been a
    sideshow for a while. Haven't had the energy or the time to push my personal
    projects forward. Personal life is in a state of questions, towards myself
    and others. Keep yourself and others safe.
</p>

<p>20-03-2021</p>
<p>
    Front end stuff keeps me occupied. Frameworks are starting to open up too.
    Working on my final paper for the TKEAT. Personal life has seen some major
    changes too, new address to share with a special someone. Tech in a freetime
    pleasure hasnt happened... Pokemon GO is fun tho :O
</p>

<p>18-12-2020</p>
<p>
    Phew, what a year. Lots has happened professionally and personally. h2c
    studies didnt pan out. Still doing those openUni front end courses, also the
    product manager program. <br />Take care, mask the f up. All the best for
    2021!
</p>

<p>16-07-2020</p>
<p>
    The wave of social engineering hacks that happened on Twitter, woah and wow.
    Really bad.
</p>
<p>
    Python and Front end still in the works. No school admittance, so I continue
    my work with open courses for the uni. Went full Apple during the spring and
    summer, We'll have to see how long this fares...
</p>

    Blergh, ex-landlord keeps giving me bad news after bad news. Stressed about
    such a mundane thing.<br />
    Not really coding per say, but got my feet wet real well with
    html-frameworks. This still looks like a work in erm, pieces. Once I feel
    comfortable with html and css, js will come.
</p>
<p>
    About tech, since that the thing I mostly write here about: Olympus Tough
    TG-Tracker going rounds now, love the quality of high speed video. Still
    something I haven't been able to capture with DSLR. And from DSLR's, the
    Nikon 7xxxx series looks really good to my eye, the old Canon 500D is ready
    to retire. All in all, this social distancing and all has given me more time
    to focus. Stay safe and healthy. Love ya. Oh, and gotta say I love the Tom
    of Finland sheets I got...
</p>

<p>19-03-2020</p>
<p>Shit is fucked. Stay safe and keep learning.</p>

<p>05-02-2020</p>

    Wow, the eldest turns 7 tomorrow. Unbelievable. macOS Catalina is getting a
    go now, first mac in years in general. The i7 laptop still rocks as my main
    rig, no problems whatsoever after the fan replacement. Video editing, photo
    manipulation, 3D rendering or gaming, no hiccups. High temps though,
    something to maybe take as a concern regarding the silicons aging/life
    expectancy. FinalMouse 2012 still rocks!
</p>

<p>02-02-2020</p>
<p>Again in 900 years.</p>

<p>21-01-2020</p>
<p>Test sites up and running, finally. Fullstack courses ongoing for hUNI.</p>

<p>03-01-2020</p>
<p>
    Woah, time really flies. Guess it's the getting older thing they keep
    talking about. Anyhooooow, two "major" projects going on, frontend both of
    em. Got a laptop with i7-8750h, huge compute, much power (consumption
    too...). Happy New Year ;)
</p>

<p>08-11-2019</p>
<p>Ooops, kinda forgot the updates.</p>

<p>28-05-2019</p>

    Woop woop, international Arduino day on 16th. Getting some fancy stuff done
    with proper thinker. OpenSCAD is THE tool, really cool for modeling and just
    tinkering around with 3d space. Luv it.
</p>

<p>25-02-2019</p>
<p>
    What is up. Hacklab project on the go. Programming for now on hold...
    Arduino and rpi stuff is still on the table too, would love to have time to
    finish those too. Also ran to .projekkkt after many many years. As a total
    side note: The book "Idiots around me" made me realize and somewhat accept
    my own way to ingest new things.
</p>

<p>31-12-2018</p>
<p>
    End of the year, didnt reach my goal for the year, time and schedules just
    wouldnt stretch... More to do for 2019. Happy new year!
</p>

<p>01-11-2018</p>
<p>
    Busy busy busy. Actually the whole js thing has been on hold. Getting back
    at it asap. Still reading up on the basics. Would love to get some new
    hardware btw :o
</p>

<p>23-09-2018</p>
<p>Trying to get it all fit in. Javascript is giving me a headache...</p>

<p>04-09-2018</p>
<p>
    Hmm, dont know exactly where to start. But got plans to work on my skills in
    different areas of computing. The latest updates (2016-2017) got lost in old
    servers malfunctioned harddrive. I'll get it going from here... aiming to
    get updates in here weekly.
</p>

<p>03-09-2018</p>
<p>Here we go again.</p>

<p>2017</p>
<p>Filler also. Absent.</p>

<p>2016</p>
<p>Filler.</p>

<p>26-09-2015</p>
<p>
    Hmm, kinda torn here. I have a choice to make, turning my webhosting to
    another service and FreeNAS my ass here at home, or keep going as it is. And
    maybe expand the capacity. I'm leaning on FreeNAS, simply because simplicity
    and the so called plug-and-playability of it. Maybe some testing on a
    netbook just for the luls? The webpage would still look and feel just as
    crap as before, it would simply be hosted by professionals. Should be easy
    call to make, but I do like to tinker with stuff way too much to give all
    control away, even if its only hardware side. Mhm, wait and see I guess.
</p>

<p>14-09-2015</p>
<p>((old pic, edited out) testing)</p>

    Long time no update. The boys keep growing, havent had the time to tinker
    with anything lately. Some comp management and software troubleshooting. Got
    my eyes on a Surface Pro for testing but no word yet. Still working on those
    pictures... maybe some day.
</p>

<p>22-07-2015</p>
<p>Not much going on, we had our second son a week ago. No time. lol</p>

<p>26-06-2015</p>
<p>Everything went better than expected.</p>

<p>21-06-2015</p>
<p>
    Quite satisfied with win10 preview, only thing I'm still fighting with is
    the naming policy between ms-accounts and linux / *nix platforms. Summers
    here too now, some backyard flying and tuning in, still waiting for a proper
    day to make a whole day full of flying :) Got a couple of new guys to the
    hobby, so lots of stuff to go through. There might a long delay (as if
    theres hasnt been ones already...) on the site update, got some OS based
    problems to solve before next update (those crossplatform problems to be
    exact).
</p>

<p>08-06-2015</p>
<p>
    Guess what, weather's still shit... Some new stuff to work with once again,
    laptops and some wireless controllers to fix. Mostly basic soldering. On
    pc-hardware side, theres hasnt been much going on, my workhorse is still
    running at 4,2Ghz with 16Gb of 1866 clocked memory. 750ti got its stable
    clocks at 125 / 200, and the temperatures all around the case are around 40
    celsius max. Should free up more time to get it to higher clocks.
</p>

<p>23-05-2015</p>
<p>
    Got a i5 4690k to fumble with, not sure about its overclocking perfomance
    yet. Havent had the time to run it thoroughly. Some motherboards and memkits
    too, still DDR3 gen stuff. Still no able-to-fly weathers here, got some new
    batteries for longer sessions. I now have a backroom overclocking project,
    with E8300 and E8400 rocks.
</p>

<p>08-05-2015</p>
<p>
    Phew, busy couple of weeks, got some new toys to play with; Mostly pc
    hardware. Waiting for the upgrade package to my daily rig, finally bowing to
    Intel. Still no good enough weather to fly properly or with time.
</p>

<p>28-04-2015</p>
<p>
    Got fucked, homeserver data migration didnt go as planned... surprise
    surprise. Didnt have everything backed up so we're rolling back a bit.
</p>

<p>08-04-2015 // from backups</p>
<p>
    RetroPi and some controllers are next on my scope. GTX750ti is back to
    default clocks, after a 4 days of stress testing it gave up. Maybe I was
    asking for too much... Unsoldered some r/c transmitter parts for a DEVO10
    mod (Deviation), more receivers to work with just one transmitter.
</p>

<p>04-04-2015</p>
<p>
    Lots of soldering work done on the r/c-stuff, getting ready for summer! On
    pc side I managed to get my GTX750ti overclock more than 120Mhz with the
    stock cooler and run stable, good one in my books. The family car got
    exchanged too, now driving a Peugeot 508 sw. No brand loyalty here.
</p>

<p>27-03-2015</p>

    More stuff arrived today, some for RPi2 setups. There were some general
    tools too, breadboard with plugins, third hands and cables. I need to retake
    that ASCII picture at the bottom, too much black <br />
    (unneccessary) lining atm.
</p>

<p>23-03-2015</p>
<p>
    Minor website updates, bringing CSS back. RPi2 temperature went downhill a
    lot, after installing heatsinks and the modified case. Also, I'm tempted to
    bring pictures here, we'll see.
</p>

<p>21-03-2015</p>
<p>
    Rpi2 setup was a success, after I noticed the nosound effect was caused by
    the tv I used. Theres more than enough processing power in that card, for
    any livingroom use. (wohoo for quakelive streams!) Picking up the lead on
    python once again...
</p>

<p>17-03-2015</p>
<p>
    Raspberry Pi 2 arrived! Dwelling into python with it... We'll see how it
    goes. Not sure if it actually needs those heatsinks?
</p>

<p>07-03-2015</p>
<p>
    Finally got my order in for Raspberry Pi 2, the wait has begun... For whole
    family entertainment use ofcourse, in some point it could be a great
    learning platform for my son. Maybe. Oh, and I resisted the urge, didnt
    order The Infinity keyboard!
</p>

<p>05-03-2015</p>
<p>
    Suffered my first back injury for the year, been too long ( a month )
    without proper training and thats the outcome. A good reminder when you let
    the yourself slip from training. Stuff I've been working on in my freetime
    got pushed back a bit.
</p>

<p>02-03-2015</p>
<p>
    Tablet got rooted and all good, wish they'd make better decisions regarding
    bloatware... So much work just to get it clean for just basic use. My own
    workstation at home got some ergonomical upgrades, we'll see if these
    changes will relieve some joint pain from my wrists.
</p>

<p>26-02-2015</p>
<p>
    Got my hands on Samsung SM-T535 tablet, trying to work out root privileges
    on it. Found out one could run VirtualPCs on it. Could prove to be useful.
    Also noticed Infinity keyboard groupbuy, so tempted...
</p>

<p>22-02-2015</p>
<p>
    Motherf*****, html... Long time no see with html in general and I'm soooooo
    out. Propably better sticking to this layout for now.
</p>

<p>20-02-2015</p>
<p>
    Minor adjustments to the server settings. Considering Teensy as the main
    candidate for my diy-keyboard project, meanwhile trying to adjust to my
    current 60% keyboard...
</p>

<p>19-02-2015</p>
<p>Transition to newer hardware and nginx complete.</p>
<p></p>
