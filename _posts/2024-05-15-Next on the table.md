# Next on the table: CAN bus exploration for electronic turbo control

While meeting my friend from the eastern parts of Finland, we had a talk about motor racing and the equipment and parts related to the technical aspects of the sport.
Just as a side track for him: to encounter a electronically controlled turbo charger, that was in use for certain few models of VAG produced cars.
For me it suits perfectly well to my Internet of Things studies and the Arduino platform, a CAN bus shield and lots of reverse engineering. To determine the controls for the electronic turbo in relation to the motor and / or the information from the CCU.
Will be running through the process of it here, once I've rolled my sleeves. Updated to come :)
