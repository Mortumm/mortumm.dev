## Mortumm = Nuno M

This my very own small corner in the web. An engineer to be, current focus is on server infrastructure and cloud solutions. Mix in some software development too.

Here you can find my curriculum vitae and the random ramblings from all walks of life, hardware and software from a technical point of view mostly.

## Contact

You can reach me on most platforms by the handle @mortumm .

Or you could just write me a nice letter to the following address me ( a ) nunofix dot com

## Thanks

My family for all the support, the few close friends (yes, you!) and PQuod for the fantastic site theme this site is built upon.
